The OpenControl Symposium will center around understanding
the OpenControl framework for automating compliance assessment and authorization packages. In close
collaboration with 18F (a federal government team), GovReady, and
other industry partners, this virtual symposium will bring together
thought leaders to introduce the idea of automated compliance
and to show the developments taking place within
the open-source community under the OpenControl project.

## You're Invited

We invite all **technologists**, **government staff**, **contractors**, **security experts**, **compliance experts**, and
others in related regulated fields who are interested in learning
about aligning security assessments and authorization with
modern, continuous software development and delivery practices.

## Where
